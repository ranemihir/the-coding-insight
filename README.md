# The Coding Insight
The Coding Insight is my personal blogging website about technology and computer programming.

# Specifications
- The website is created using Nuxt.js (a Vue.js framework for better Server-side rendering) and Google Firebase (on the backend). 

- MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern is used.

- A design framework called 'Vuetify' which is an implementation of Material Design Framework for Vue.js is used for frontend design.

- Instead of using the default Firebase authentication, a custom authentication system based on the Firbase documentation is implemented.

- A WYSIWYG editor called Editor.js is used for writing and editing post whose exclusive authorization is given to only the admin of the website.
