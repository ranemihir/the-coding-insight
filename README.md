# The Coding Insight
The Coding Insight is my personal blogging website about technology and computer programming.

Website Link : [https://thecodinginsight.web.app/](https://thecodinginsight.web.app/)

## Technical Specifications
- The website is created using [**Nuxt.js**](https://nuxtjs.org/) (a Vue.js framework for better Server-side rendering) and [**Google Firebase**](https://firebase.google.com/) (on the backend). 

- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** design pattern is used.

- A design framework called [**Vuetify**](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) which is an implementation of Material Design Framework for Vue.js is used for frontend design.

- Instead of using the default Firebase authentication, a custom authentication system based on the Firbase documentation is implemented.

- A WYSIWYG editor called [**Editor.js**](https://editorjs.io/) is used for writing and editing post whose exclusive authorization is given to only the admin of the website.
